# Question_1
You are given the numbers a, b to display the infinite sequence of numbers a,a+b,a+2∗b ...,a+N∗b,a+(N+1)∗b,.... Bob has made a mistake, he namely forgot to draw a space 
for the separation between the numbers, resulting in a long line of numbers. In order not to correct the mistake, Bob decided to find out how to find the kth digit in the formed line (numbering of 
digits begins with one).

Bob could not find a good solution, so he asks you for help.

Input format
• The first line contains a number T denoting the number of tests.
• The first line of each test contains four integers a,b,k.

Output format
Print the kth digit for each test.
